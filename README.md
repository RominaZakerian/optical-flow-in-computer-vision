optical flow for tracking objects.
In this project, some objects tracked by optical flow algorithm.

In q1.py corners of the object detected with Shi-Thomas algorithm.

In q2.py the object tracked with Lukas-Kanade algorithm.

In q5.py the object tracked with Gunner Farneback algorithm.

the videos have been saved with seperated names.
